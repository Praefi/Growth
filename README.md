# Growth
An advanced game

I created this repository to work with some of my friends on the Game "Growth" which i wrote with sixteen days of Programming-Experience. I am a mathematic student with no focus on informatic and thats the reason why my code is just exploding and annoying for professionals, but it's the result of using almost all what i learned yet (in 16 days). Hoping to evolve this game to an app one day, i will try my best. What a pity that programming is a brand new world for me.
Uploading my project is hopefully the right step according to develop my idea without losing possesion.
P.S.: I am sorry for my english, i liked german as subject much more in school.
